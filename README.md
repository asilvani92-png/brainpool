**Global free AI API endpoint pool. Self-maintaining, aggregated, open.**

Brainpool aggregates free AI endpoints from 7 sources (5 legitimate free-tier providers + 2 gray-market meta-sources), validates every one for liveness, model identity, latency, and rate-limit state, then exports curated lists and serves them via an OpenAI-compatible REST API with failover routing. Runs every 20 minutes on GitHub Actions using 12 parallel validation runners.

## Pipeline

```
SCRAPE (1 runner, ~15s)
  7 sources → dedup → inject alive endpoints from DB → blacklist dead

    └── SHARD 11 ──┘  alive + model-detect + latency + rate-limit state

```

**Warm runs:** ~3-8 min. **Every 20 minutes. $0 cost (public repo).**

## Sources

Counts from latest pipeline run (auto-updated).

### Legitimate free tiers (`tier=official`)

| Source | What it provides | Requires |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| OpenRouter | All models with pricing `$0/$0` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Groq | Full active model list, generous free rate limits | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| Google AI Studio | All Gemini models that support `generateContent` | `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY` |
| Huggingface Inference | Curated set of serverless text-gen models | `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` |
| Cloudflare Workers AI | Text-generation models under `@cf/` | `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` |

### Gray-market meta-sources (`tier=reverse`)

| Source | What it provides |
|--------|------------------|
| gpt4free-providers | Base URLs extracted from `xtekky/gpt4free`'s `g4f/Provider/` directory |
| awesome-free-ai | URLs scraped from community-curated free-AI README files (cheahjs, zukixa) |

Gray-market endpoints are probed on every run. Ones that respond are promoted into the live pool; ones that consistently fail fall into the blacklist window.

---

## Validation

Every endpoint gets a configurable hard timeout (60s default) and these checks:

| Check | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Alive** | Sends a short prompt (`"Respond with ONLY the three letters OK"`) through the endpoint's native API shape (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Huggingface) |
| **Latency** | Round-trip time for the alive probe in milliseconds |
| **Model detection** | Sends `"What model are you?"` and regex-matches 30+ known model names to normalize identity |
| **Family classification** | Buckets into `gpt`, `claude`, `gemini`, `llama`, `mistral`, `qwen`, `deepseek`, or `other` |
| **Rate-limit state** | HTTP 429 + body-text heuristics flag `rate_limited=1` |
| **Shape adaptation** | Requests/responses translated per API kind so the router exposes a uniform OpenAI interface |

## Endpoint Files

Updated every 20 minutes via GitHub Actions. All files are JSONL — one endpoint per line — and intentionally exclude `auth_value` so they are safe to publish.

| [`data/stats.json`](data/stats.json) | Pool health with source quality metrics |

## API

REST API on port 3000. Rate limited to 60 req/min per IP.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Health |
| `/endpoints` | GET | Filtered endpoint list. Params: `model_family`, `api_kind`, `tier`, `provider`, `model_detected`, `free_tier_only`, `max_latency_ms`, `limit`, `offset` |
| `/stats` | GET | Pool health, family/provider/tier breakdowns |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | POST | OpenAI-compatible chat proxy. Picks best live upstream for requested `model`, fails over on 429 / 5xx |
| `/v1/models` | GET | OpenAI-compatible model list stub |

The router translates between the OpenAI chat schema and the target upstream's schema (Anthropic messages, Gemini generateContent, Huggingface inputs) so clients pointed at Brainpool can talk to any backend transparently.

## Architecture

### GitHub Actions Pipeline

3-phase pipeline across 14 runners, every 20 minutes:

1. **Scrape** (1 runner, ~15s) — 7 sources, dedup by `endpoint_id`, inject alive endpoints from DB, blacklist dead, upload artifact
2. **Validate** (12 runners in parallel, ~3-20 min) — 20 concurrency, hard timeouts, model-detect probe, streams to JSONL
3. **Merge** (1 runner, ~15s) — combine shards, upsert SQLite, export, commit

### Blacklist

SQLite DB cached between Actions runs. Endpoints where `alive = 0 AND last_checked >= now - 3h` are skipped. Subsequent runs only validate new + previously-alive endpoints.

### Safety & Guardrails

- Configurable hard timeout per endpoint (default 60s)
- 50-minute global validation deadline
- `fail-fast: false` on matrix (one shard failing doesn't kill others)
- `if: always()` on commit and merge (partial results still saved)
- Concurrency group prevents overlapping Actions runs
- `git pull --rebase` before push (handles concurrent commits)
- `auth_value` never written to export files — only lives in the DB and the running server process

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture.

## Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Runtime | Node.js 22+ (TypeScript, ESM) |
| HTTP | Hono |
| Database | SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL) |
| Concurrency | `p-limit` |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (12 shards, every 20 min, $0) |

## Security

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.

- Auth material stored in DB, never in exports or logs
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints (60 req/min)
- Configurable hard timeout prevents hung upstreams
- Non-retryable upstream errors short-circuit the router
- Gray-market endpoints are isolated by `tier=reverse` for downstream filtering
- Free endpoints are untrusted — never send credentials, PII, or proprietary content through them
